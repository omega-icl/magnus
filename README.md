# MAGNUS: Modeling, Analysis & desiGN of Uncertain Systems #

MAGNUS provides a collection of classes to support the development and analysis of mathematical models. It is written in C++ to promote execution speed and includes Python binders through [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

MAGNUS builds on [MC++](https://github.com/omega-icl/mcpp) for expression tree manipulation, differentiation and evaluation, along with [CRONOS](https://github.com/omega-icl/cronos) for numerical integration and sensitivity analysis of dynamic systems and [CANON](https://github.com/omega-icl/canon) for local and global numerical optimization.

The present version 1.1 of MAGNUS comprises modules for:

* Parameter estimation in mathematical models
* Model-based feasibility analysis using nested sampling
* Model-based design of experiments

A range of python notebooks are provided in `src/interface` to illustrate these modules.
